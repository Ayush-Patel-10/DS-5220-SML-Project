# DS-5220-SML-Project

• Designed a CNN-based classifier to predict Alzheimer's and distinguish between current stages of dementia.
• Used feature selection to extract texture and shape aspects of the Hippocampus region from MRI scan.
• Analyzed and compared performances of SOTA models for the detection of various stages of Alzheimer's.
• Achieved an average testing accuracy of 93% with a CNN-based classifier after the introduction of additional 
dropout layers along with categorical cross entropy as a loss function
